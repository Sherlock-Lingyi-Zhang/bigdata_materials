# Introduction to Cloud Computing and AWS

## Learning Objectives

The fate of big data has become increasingly intertwined with cloud computing. Many companies are leveraging cloud computing to increase agility, lower cost, and keep up with innovation. Big data, in particular, shines in the cloud environment as it can reduce the complexity of managing a big data platform, auto-scale, and lower costs. 

In this section, you will learn:

- Concepts of cloud computing, virtualization, and containerization
- Introduction to (AWS) and key components
- AWS big data line up and use cases
- Comparison between cloud computing platforms
- Learn how to launch an EC2 instance and start a Hive job
- Learn how to run a Jupyter Notebook on Amazon EMR
