# Introduction to Hadoop and Ecosystems

## Learning Objectives

The purpose of this module is to give you a quick overview of Hadoop and its ecosystem, which forms the core of the big data technology landscape. The ecosystem is quite complex and evolves quickly. We hope that through this introduction helps you to get a sense of where different pieces of technology fit into the bigger picture. We will also briefly introduce Sqoop.

In this section, you will learn

- The motivation behind Hadoop
- What Hadoop is and what significant features it provides
- How does it offer reliable storage for massive amounts of data with HDFS
- How does it support large scale data processing through MapReduce
- How Hadoop has evolved overtime
- What are key members of the Hadoop ecosystem
- The role of Hadoop in data centers
- How cloud computing has changed big data
- How to use sqoop to import RDBMS tables into Hadoop
